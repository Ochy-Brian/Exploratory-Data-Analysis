It involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its key characteristics, uncover patterns and identify relationships between variables
                                             Types of exploratory data analysis
1.Univariate
2.Bivariate
3.Multivariate
Univariate analysis focuses on a single variable to understand its internal structure and it is primarily concerned with describing the data and finding patterns existing in a single feature
                                                    Common techniques include 
1.Histograms
2.Boxplot
3.Bar charts
4.Summary statistics
                                                                       Bivariate analysis 
This involves the exploring the connection between variables
                                                                  Key techniques
1.Scatter plot
2.Correlation coefficient
3.Cross tabulation
4.Line graphs
5.Covariance

                                                             Multivariate analysis
This examines the relationship between two or more variables in the dataset
                                                         Techniques include
1.Pair plots
